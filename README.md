Software Modelling project 1 notes:
Question 1:
Edit roll method in navigation pane to loop the animation and store overall dice roll in an attribute
May also need to edit the Die class

Question 2:
Use connection between puppet and navigation pane to track whether nbsteps = num of dice
In act method of puppet modify if statement for checking for connection

Question 3:
Create new methods in puppet that access other players information through navigation pane

Question 4:
Logic for simulated players will be written in SimulatedPlayer class
The Boolean for toggle is isToggle which is on line 208 in NavigationPane
Puppet class will handle how to react to connections based on toggle

Question 5:
Also could improve cohesion to do it in a different class
